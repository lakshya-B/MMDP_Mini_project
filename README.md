## AUDIO

## CLASSES

Each class in the dataset consists of around 5 mins audio samples, mirroring the structure of the image classes. Below are examples of some audio samples.
Here, I'm presenting a .MOV file as a placeholder for the .mp3 files, as .mp3 files cannot be displayed directly on GitHub README.
